# Coronavirus-Projects
These are all the Coronavirus Projects that I have been working on for some time. 

# Face-Mask Detector
This program will use a combination of previously used models developed in order to detect the presence of a mask. It uses the library ArgParse to parse through different inputs like the video feed that you want to use. 

# Object Tracking
This program will try to track people as they walk by. It will use OpenCV to first detect a person in the frame, then it will attempt to track them as they move across the frame. This would be most useful for trying to track how many people are entering a given store.
